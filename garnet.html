      <h2>About Garnet</h2>
      <p>
        Garnet is the fusion of Ruby and Sapphire and the current de-facto leader of the Crystal Gems. Garnet is one of the last surviving Gems on Earth who joined the Crystal Gems in the Rebellion against the Gem Homeworld and afterward assisted her friends in protecting the Earth over the next few millennia. After Rose Quartz gave up her physical form to give birth to her son, Steven Universe, Garnet took over as the leader of the group. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Years later, Garnet is still an extremely stable fusion, living a loving and peaceful life among the Crystal Gems and their uncorrupted allies. This life came under threat when Spinel returned and struck her with a Gem Rejuvenator, wiping her memories and separating Ruby and Sapphire. The two then fuse accidentally and are subsequently restored when she is reminded of the value of truth and love. Garnet no longer feels pressured or overwhelmed due to her future vision which had caused her to once be stoic and distant, but instead is ready to face the future as it naturally unfolds.
