      <h2>About Pearl</h2>
      <p>
        Pearl is a member of the Crystal Gems. She was Pink Diamond's second Pearl, and one of Rose Quartz's closest followers and her sole confidant. Pearl is one of the last surviving Gems on Earth who joined the Crystal Gems in their rebellion against the Gem Homeworld. Pearl would afterward protect the Earth over the next several millennia alongside her friends, while later teaching Steven the ways of Gems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Years later, Pearl is no longer suffering from issues of self-worth and finds her way, knowing she is herself. Though she is struck and has her memories wiped by Spinel's rejuvenator, she gets her memories back by having Greg and Steven fuse into Steg, who reminds her of her independence. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Pearl now teaches at Little Homeschool, teaching Gems how to interact with human beings. While she previously seemed to find interaction with humans uncomfortable, Pearl now actively partakes in it and encourages other Gems to do the same.
