      <h2>About Amethyst</h2>
      <p>
        Amethyst (specifically Amethyst Facet-5 Cut-8XM) is a member of the Crystal Gems. She is the last known Gem manufactured on Earth as a part of the Gem Homeworld's Kindergarten project, being one of the last surviving Gems on Earth. After being found by Rose Quartz and the other Crystal Gems, Amethyst helped her friends protect the Earth over the next four millennia, and often aids in the shenanigans of Steven Universe. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Years later, Amethyst lives a peaceful life with the Crystal Gems, no longer struggling with low self-esteem. Though she was struck by a Gem rejuvenator during Spinel's return and had her memory wiped, Amethyst was eventually restored by Steven, who helps her recall her fondness for him and her team through past experiences on Earth. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Amethyst, alongside her fellow Crystal Gems, currently teaches at Little Homeschool. Despite once struggling with figuring out who she was, as well as battling self-confidence issues surrounding her appearance, Amethyst has since found peace and now assists other Gems in finding themselves as well.
